=====================

The prerequisite is that you need the DataNucleus Maven2 plugin installed.
You can download this plugin from the DataNucleus downloads area.

1. Set the database configuration in the "src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml" file.

2. Make sure you have the JDBC driver jar specified in the "pom.xml" file

3. Run the command: "mvn clean compile"
   This builds everything, and enhances the classes
