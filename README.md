sample-jdoql-method
===================

Sample showing how to add support for a Java method to JDOQL for RDBMS,
and an evaluator for use when evaluating the query in-memory.

Look at

* <a href="https://github.com/datanucleus/sample-jdoql-method/blob/master/src/main/resources/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF">src/main/resources/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</a>   The MANIFEST file for the plugin jar, defining the plugin imports/exports.
* <a href="https://github.com/datanucleus/sample-jdoql-method/blob/master/src/main/resources/plugin.xml">src/main/resources/plugin.xml</a>   The plugin.xml file for the plugin jar, defining what features are being provided by this plugin.

Provides a very simple test of the use of this JDOQL method.
